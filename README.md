### ðŸ“Œ About Me

After spending several years working in mechanical engineering, I realized my passion for technology and mobile development.  
I decided to pivot into **Flutter development**, and since then, Iâ€™ve been building responsive, user-friendly apps.

I love problem-solving and learning new technologies, and I believe my background in engineering helps me approach challenges with a unique perspective.
